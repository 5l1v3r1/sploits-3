# domains2scope

This Burp extesion adds to Burp the ability to add or exclude domains to burp's scope by selecting one or many items in the Proxy History or Repeater and selecting either Domain2Scope or  !Domain2Scope.

Burp currently has an option add items from the proxy history to the scope but this is very specific. It will only add the exact protocol and exact path to the scope.

This plugin adds both http and https and only adds the domain w/o path information.
